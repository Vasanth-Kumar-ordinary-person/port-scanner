🚀 Port Scanner in Python using Tkinter

I recently created a simple port scanner using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface. This tool allows you to scan for open ports on a target host, providing valuable insights into the available services.

👉 How it works:

Enter the target host (use 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' for your local machine).
Click the "Scan Ports" button.
The script iterates through port numbers, checking for open ports on the specified host.
Results are displayed in a Tkinter window, showing open ports and the time taken for the scan.

Python for scripting
Tkinter for the GUI
Socket module for network communication
